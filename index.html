                Hi! I am Gaurab Das, a rising junior at MIT pursuing a SB (Bachelors of Science) in Electrical Engineering 
                and Computer Science (Course 6-2), expecting to graduate in May 2025. I am also a current Engineering
                Intern at NASA JPL, where I work on developing advanced radar waveforms for communication 
                systems on the Lunar South Pole.
                <br>
                <br>
                While I tend to have a broad interest in the applications of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a vast
                variety of topics, I have a deep passion in areas pertaining to autonomous operations, specialized hardware and
                learning algorithms. I love taking classes that are both very hardware or very software oriented, have work 
                experience in fields such as machine learning, software development, electronics and data analysis, and dabble in a few
                personal projects ocassionally.
                <br>
                <br>
                While my primary identity revolves around being an aspiring engineer, my other interests revolve around playing 
                table tennis and poker, reading anything I can get my hands on, practicing the guitar (rare), and fooling around with friends.
                If you want to hear a fun story, ask me about how I skipped a year of school because I got assigned the wrong paper.
